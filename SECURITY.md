**Fixes shipped this revision:**
- C-01, C-02: `smart_treasury` rewritten with real `Balance<T>` field, AdminCap-gated withdraw, events instead of per-call shared objects.
- C-03, H-01, H-02, H-03: `payment_intent` rewritten — sender from `tx_context`, `Clock` for expiration, sender-only confirm, overpay refund via `coin::split`.
- H-05: `peg_monitor::init_peg_state` now initializes deviations above `MAX_DEVIATION_PPM` so `assert_pegged` fails until first real `update_peg`.
- H-06: fee gouging (already fixed in prior revision).
- M-01, M-02, M-03: `audit_anchor` AdminCap-gated, tautological `verify_anchor` replaced with event-emitting verifier; `receipt_v2::link_audit_anchor` removed (truly immutable now).
- M-04, M-05: named abort codes throughout, no more shared-object-per-rebalance.
- L-06: `peg_monitor::update_peg` enforces monotonic timestamps (new code 303).
- Off-chain `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts::ABORT_CODES` registry expanded to cover all 25 codes across all 8 modules.

The protocol cleanly separates settlement, peg monitoring, business identity, and dual-stablecoin TTL handling — those four modules (`settlement`, `peg_monitor`, `business_account`, `dual_treasury`) are well-structured and resource-safe.

The remaining four modules (`smart_treasury`, `payment_intent`, `audit_anchor`, `receipt_v2`) are explicitly labelled "Phase 1 scaffold" in their headers. They are **not production-grade** in their current form — `smart_treasury::add_usdc` is fundamentally broken, `payment_intent::create_payment_intent` accepts spoofed sender addresses, and several functions have no authorization at all. **Do not publish these scaffold modules to mainnet** without rewriting.

---

## Findings

### C-01 · `smart_treasury::add_usdc` always aborts on non-zero coins
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/smart_treasury.move:51-61`

The function adds the coin's value to `treasury.usdc_balance` (a `u64` counter), then calls `coin::destroy_zero(usdc_coin)`. `destroy_zero` aborts if the coin's value is non-zero — the only path that succeeds is depositing a coin of value 0, in which case the counter is also incremented by 0.

In effect, the treasury contract **cannot accept any USDC at all**. Worse, the function pretends to credit the deposit before aborting, which would mislead off-chain callers reading the partial transaction trace.

The type parameter is also wrong — the function accepts `Coin<SUI>` but the field name and comments say USDC.

**Recommendation**: Rewrite to actually store the deposit in a `Balance<USDC>` field on `SmartTreasury`. Use a proper type parameter (`Coin<USDC>`). Emit a `UsdcDeposited` event. Remove the `destroy_zero` call. Mirror the pattern in `dual_treasury::deposit`.

---

### C-02 · `SmartTreasury` does not actually hold any value
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/smart_treasury.move:13-20`

`SmartTreasury` only contains `u64` counters (`usdc_balance`, `usd_balance`). There is no `Balance<T>` field on the struct. All "balances" are accounting fiction with no on-chain backing.

`rebalance_treasury` increments/decrements `usd_balance` based on an admin-supplied `amount_usd` argument — there is no movement of any actual coin. A compromised admin can mint arbitrary phantom balances; the dashboard treasury figure is unreliable.

**Recommendation**: Add `usdc_balance: Balance<USDC>` and `usd_balance: Balance<USD>` (or whatever stable type represents USD on Sui). All mutations must move real balance via `balance::join` / `balance::split`. Remove the `u64` counters or expose them as views derived from `balance::value(&field)`.

---

### C-03 · `payment_intent::create_payment_intent` accepts a spoofed `sender`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/payment_intent.move:26-50`

The function takes `sender: address` as a caller-supplied parameter rather than reading it from `tx_context::sender(ctx)`. Any caller can therefore create a `PaymentIntent` claiming any address as the sender.

Downstream, `recipient` is also caller-supplied — combined, an attacker can fabricate intents that look like they came from victim A and pay attacker B, and these intents will appear in off-chain indexers as if A authorized them. Even if `confirm_payment_intent` requires the right coin, the intent itself is a falsifiable record on-chain.

**Recommendation**:
```move
public entry fun create_payment_intent(
    recipient: address,
    amount_usd: u64,
    target_currency: String,
    fx_rate_usd_local: u64,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
    let sender = tx_context::sender(ctx);
    // ...
}
```
Same pattern applies anywhere `address` is taken as an argument that should be the caller.

---

### H-01 · `payment_intent` uses `epoch_timestamp_ms` instead of `Clock`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/payment_intent.move:34, 59, 72`

`tx_context::epoch_timestamp_ms(ctx)` returns the epoch start time, which only advances at epoch boundaries (~24 hours on Sui mainnet). The 5-minute expiration window (`now + 300_000`) is therefore meaningless — within the same epoch, every `confirm_payment_intent` and `cancel_payment_intent` call sees the same "now". Expired intents may remain confirmable for hours; pending intents may show as expired immediately at an epoch boundary.

**Recommendation**: Take `clock: &Clock` parameter and call `clock::timestamp_ms(clock)`. Match the pattern already used in `peg_monitor` and `settlement`.

---

### H-02 · `payment_intent::confirm_payment_intent` has no sender authorization
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/payment_intent.move:53-68`

The intent is a `key + store` shared object after `transfer::share_object`. Any address can therefore call `confirm_payment_intent` with any coin ≥ `intent.amount_usd`. This enables griefing — a third party can confirm an intent at the cheapest possible payment, draining the recipient's expected upside, or front-running with a cheaper coin denomination.

**Recommendation**: Add `assert!(tx_context::sender(ctx) == intent.sender, E_UNAUTHORIZED);`. Or: require the caller to hold a `PaymentApprovalCap` minted at intent creation and given only to the sender.

---

### H-03 · `payment_intent::confirm_payment_intent` over-charges silently
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/payment_intent.move:61-67`

The check is `amount >= intent.amount_usd`, then the **entire** payment coin is forwarded to the recipient. If the caller supplies a 100 SUI coin to confirm a 1 SUI intent, the recipient receives 100 SUI and there is no refund of the 99 SUI overpay.

**Recommendation**: Split the coin: `let to_pay = coin::split(&mut payment, intent.amount_usd, ctx);` then transfer only `to_pay` to recipient and return `payment` to sender (or destroy if zero). Pattern already used in `settlement::settle_payment` for the fee split.

---

### H-04 · `business_account::submit_application` has no rate limit
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/business_account.move:39-59`

Anyone can call `submit_application` unlimited times, each call mints a new `BusinessAccount` UID. This is a denial-of-service vector against the off-chain Sumsub indexer and inflates the object table.

**Recommendation**: Either gate creation behind a fee (a small SUI burn deters spam), or require a one-shot capability minted by AdminCap. At minimum, enforce one-application-per-sender by storing applicant addresses in a shared `Table<address, bool>` and asserting they're not already present.

---

### H-05 · `peg_monitor::init_peg_state` initializes deviation at 0 with a current timestamp
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/peg_monitor.move:47-56`

After init, `assert_pegged` passes immediately because (a) deviations are 0 and (b) `last_update_ms = clock::timestamp_ms(clock)`. The first ~60 seconds after init, settlements proceed against zero peg data — without the operator daemon ever having pushed a real Pyth reading.

**Recommendation**: Initialize `usdc_deviation_ppm: MAX_DEVIATION_PPM + 1` and `usdt_deviation_ppm: MAX_DEVIATION_PPM + 1` so `assert_pegged` aborts until the first real `update_peg` lands. Or set `last_update_ms = 0` so staleness check fails until first update.

---

### H-06 · Fee gouging via unbounded `FEE_BPS`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: **Fixed** (2026-05-29)
**Location**: `move/sources/settlement.move`

The contract previously hardcoded `FEE_BPS = 150` (1.50%) while the off-chain quote engine, dashboards, and marketing all advertised 0.80%–1.10%. There was no way to align them without redeploying. Worse — any future change to the constant required a full upgrade.

**Resolution**: `settle_payment` and `settle_batch` now take `fee_bps: u64` as a parameter, bounded by `MAX_FEE_BPS = 200` via `assert!(fee_bps <= MAX_FEE_BPS, E_FEE_EXCEEDED)`. Per-corridor fees are defined in `lib/fx/corridors.ts` and passed by the off-chain settlement layer. The contract emits `fee_bps` in `PaymentSettled` and `PaymentExecuted` for full auditability. See `lib/fx/corridors.ts`, `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts`, and `lib/sui/contracts.ts` for the off-chain pieces.

---

### M-01 · `audit_anchor::anchor_audit_hash` has no caller authorization
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/audit_anchor.move:20-34`

Anyone can call this entry function and create `AuditAnchor` shared objects with arbitrary hashes. The audit trail can be polluted with junk anchors that look identical to real ones to a naive off-chain reader.

**Recommendation**: Gate with `AdminCap` (matching `peg_monitor::update_peg`), or accept a `BusinessAccount` reference and assert `is_verified`. Add a `business_account_id: address` field to the anchor so off-chain indexers can filter by tenant.

---

### M-02 · `audit_anchor::verify_anchor` is tautological
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/audit_anchor.move:37-39`

`verify_anchor(anchor, hash)` simply returns `anchor.audit_hash == hash` — i.e. it tells you whether the value you supplied matches the value already on the anchor you read. This provides no independent verification; off-chain callers can do the comparison themselves without calling the contract.

**Recommendation**: Either remove this function (misleading), or change it to verify against a Merkle root or Walrus CID that the anchor commits to — i.e. give it meaning beyond a string equality check.

---

### M-03 · `receipt_v2::link_audit_anchor` lacks authorization
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/receipt_v2.move:56-62`

The receipt is a shared object; any caller can mutate `audit_anchor_id` to point to a different (possibly fake) anchor. A receipt's audit linkage is therefore not tamper-evident on chain.

**Recommendation**: Require `AdminCap` OR `assert!(tx_context::sender(ctx) == receipt.sender)`. Better: link the anchor at receipt creation and remove the post-hoc setter entirely (immutable receipts).

---

### M-04 · `smart_treasury::rebalance_treasury` shares an object per call
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/smart_treasury.move:64-93`

Every rebalance call creates a new `TreasuryRebalance` shared object via `transfer::share_object`. Over time this fills the object table with one shared object per rebalance event — expensive in storage and gas, hard to query.

**Recommendation**: Replace with an event: `event::emit(TreasuryRebalanced { ... })`. Events are cheap, queryable from indexers, and don't add to the object table.

---

### M-05 · Magic abort codes throughout scaffold modules
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `payment_intent.move:58, 59, 62, 72` · `smart_treasury.move:56, 70, 77`

Scaffold modules use bare integers (`assert!(..., 0)`, `assert!(..., 1)`, etc.) instead of named `const E_FOO: u64 = N;` constants. Diagnosing reverts requires reading the source — off-chain error mapping (see `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts::ABORT_CODES`) has no way to associate human-readable strings with anonymous codes.

**Recommendation**: Define named constants at module top, matching the `E_FOO` convention used in `settlement.move` and `peg_monitor.move`. Add the new codes to `lib/server/sui-settlement.ts::ABORT_CODES`.

---

### M-06 · `business_account::AdminCap` is single-key with no rotation
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open (architectural)
**Location**: `move/sources/business_account.move:34-36`

`init` mints one `AdminCap` and transfers it to the deployer. There is no multi-sig, no time-locked rotation, no recovery path. If the deployer's key is lost, every admin function (peg updates, KYB verification, treasury seed) becomes uncallable forever — protocol bricked.

**Recommendation**: Wrap `AdminCap` usage behind a multi-sig pattern at the address level (use Sui multisig), or build an on-chain governance module with N-of-M keyholders that can mint replacement AdminCaps after a timelock. At minimum, document the operational policy: where the key lives, who has access, what the rotation cadence is, what the recovery plan is if the key is lost.

---

### M-07 · `dual_treasury` resets TTL on every deposit
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/dual_treasury.move:62-63`

`deposit` overwrites `buffer.intake_ms = now_ms` on each call. Old funds in the buffer get a fresh TTL whenever new funds are added — meaning a 29-minute-old position can be reset to 0 by depositing 1 wei of USDT, indefinitely keeping funds past the intended `USDT_MAX_HOLD_MS` ceiling. The `emergency_sweep` trigger never fires for actively topped-up buffers.

**Recommendation**: Track per-batch intake (e.g. `Table<u64, u64>` keyed by batch id → intake_ms) and enforce TTL per oldest batch. Or: forbid deposits when `buffer.balance > 0` — force one-batch-at-a-time accounting.

---

### M-08 · `dual_treasury` parameter naming hides cap discard
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/dual_treasury.move:54, 75, 99`

Functions take `cap: &AdminCap` then do `let _ = cap;`. This works (the borrow still requires the cap to exist), but the pattern is non-idiomatic and easy to overlook in review — a future change could remove the `let _` line and the borrow would optimize away, breaking access control silently.

**Recommendation**: Use `_admin: &AdminCap` parameter name (Move/Rust convention for "intentionally unused reference"). Match `peg_monitor::update_peg` style.

---

### L-01 · `settlement.move` `MAX_FEE_BPS = 200` may be too loose
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open (advisory)
**Location**: `move/sources/settlement.move:23`

Current corridor fees are 80–110 bps. The 200 bps (2%) ceiling is roughly 2× headroom — defensive but allows a misconfigured quote engine to charge double the highest legitimate fee without aborting.

**Recommendation**: Tighten to 150 bps if no genuine 1.5%+ corridors are planned. Or: emit a `HighFeeWarning` event when `fee_bps > 120` so off-chain monitors can alert on suspicious quotes.

---

### L-02 · `peg_monitor::assert_pegged` aborts on either-stablecoin break
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open (intentional conservatism)
**Location**: `move/sources/peg_monitor.move:83-89`

A USDC-denominated settlement aborts if USDT's peg is broken (and vice versa). The conservative posture is reasonable — broad peg stress usually correlates — but it does mean USDT operational issues block USDC flow.

**Recommendation**: Add `assert_pegged_for<T>(state, clock)` variants that only check the relevant stablecoin. Keep the joint check as the default for batch settlements that may mix types.

---

### L-03 · No pause / circuit breaker
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open (architectural)
**Location**: All modules

There is no `paused: bool` field gated by AdminCap that would let operators halt settlements in an incident. The only emergency lever is `peg_monitor::update_peg` with deliberately bad data (which halts all settlements but is hacky).

**Recommendation**: Add `PauseState { paused: bool }` shared object and `assert!(!pause.paused, E_PAUSED)` at the top of every settlement entry function. Gate `set_pause` with `AdminCap`.

---

### L-04 · `business_account::submit_application` uses `#[allow(lint(self_transfer))]`
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open (design choice)
**Location**: `move/sources/business_account.move:38-58`

`BusinessAccount` is created and transferred to the caller as an owned object. Owned objects are harder to query in dashboards (need to iterate by address) and don't compose with other shared-object flows.

**Recommendation**: Consider making `BusinessAccount` a shared object with an `owner` field. Easier to query, easier to reference in `settle_payment` without ownership transfer juggling.

---

### L-05 · `receipt_v2` doesn't enforce caller is the actual settler
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/receipt_v2.move:26-53`

Anyone can call `create_receipt` with any data — there's no link back to a real `PaymentSettled` event or a `SettlementPool` reference. Off-chain readers cannot distinguish a real receipt from a forged one without cross-referencing the `tx_digest` to actual chain history.

**Recommendation**: Require either `AdminCap` OR a reference to the settlement pool whose event the receipt is supposed to attest to. Best: emit receipts as part of `settle_payment` rather than as a separate user-facing entry.

---

### L-06 · `peg_monitor::update_peg` lacks monotonic timestamp check
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/peg_monitor.move:59-79`

The function blindly overwrites `last_update_ms` with the current clock. If two PTBs race and the slower one lands second, the chain "remembers" the older timestamp as the latest — which is benign (still fresh) but technically not monotonic. More importantly, an admin replay attack could set the timestamp to an older value... actually no, it always reads from the `Clock`, so this is safe. Mark as informational.

**Recommendation**: Add `assert!(now > state.last_update_ms, E_TIMESTAMP_REGRESSION)` for defense in depth and to catch clock bugs early.

---

### I-01 · Inconsistent `AdminCap` parameter naming
**Severity**: Informational
**Status**: Open
**Location**: cross-module

- `peg_monitor::update_peg` — `_admin: &AdminCap` ✓
- `business_account::verify_business` — `_: &AdminCap`
- `dual_treasury::*` — `cap: &AdminCap` + `let _ = cap;`

Pick one convention (`_admin: &AdminCap` recommended).

---

### I-02 · Mixed module declaration styles
**Severity**: Informational
**Status**: Open
**Location**: cross-module

`settlement`, `business_account`, `peg_monitor`, `dual_treasury` use the short-form `module name;` (newer Move syntax). `smart_treasury`, `payment_intent`, `audit_anchor`, `receipt_v2` use the block form `module name { ... }`. This is a strong signal that the latter four are older or were copy-pasted from scaffold templates — they correlate exactly with the modules carrying the most critical findings.

**Recommendation**: Migrate scaffold modules to short-form once they're properly rewritten.

---

### I-03 · Scaffold vs production status not visible at module level
**Severity**: Informational
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `smart_treasury`, `payment_intent`, `audit_anchor`, `receipt_v2`

These four modules have doc-comments saying "Phase 1 scaffold" but nothing prevents them from being published. There is no compile-time guard preventing accidental mainnet deployment.

**Recommendation**: Add a `#[test_only]` guard until they're hardened, or split them into a `scaffolds/` subdirectory excluded from the production package via `Move.toml`.

---

### I-04 · `peg_monitor::update_peg` doesn't return new state
**Severity**: Informational
**Status**: Open
**Location**: `move/sources/peg_monitor.move:59-79`

Caller has to read `state` afterwards or parse the emitted event. Minor UX friction for PTB authors.

---

## Permanent Monitoring Checklist

These are the items the security/ops team should **always** keep eyes on. Each has a recommended cadence and alert threshold.

### Hot signals (alert immediately)

## Closing notes

**Highest-leverage next moves**, in priority order:

1. **Fix C-01, C-02, C-03 before any further work on those modules.** They are scaffolds and won't survive a real audit; pretending otherwise is worse than removing them from the package.
2. **Address H-05** (`init_peg_state` opens a 60s settlement window with zero peg data). One-line fix.
3. **Document AdminCap custody policy** (M-06). If the admin key is on a laptop somewhere, the entire protocol is one phishing email from being unrecoverable.
4. **Wire the abort code 103** into `ABORT_CODES` mapping — already done in this revision. Same pattern for any new abort codes scaffold modules add.
5. **Treat the four scaffold modules as deleted for production purposes** until rewritten. Move them under `move/sources/scaffolds/` and exclude from `Move.toml::[package].sources` until ready.

This report should be re-run after any change to `move/sources/` and committed alongside the change.
