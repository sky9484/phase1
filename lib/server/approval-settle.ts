/**
 * What happens when the last approver answers, by WhatsApp or by code.
 *
 * A WhatsApp reply, a code typed into Splash and a click in the app are three
 * ways of asking one question. The channel decides how the question was put;
 * it must not decide what an answer is worth. So the walk here is the submit
 * route's (lib/queue/approval-walk.ts): policy, quote expiry and compliance
 * re-evaluated at the moment of approval, SIMULATED → POLICY_EVALUATED →
 * PENDING_APPROVAL, then one APPROVE per ballot through the state machine.
 *
 * ─── Why this never paid anything ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It applied APPROVE to the SIMULATED proposal a money route leaves behind.
 * The state machine takes APPROVE only from PENDING_APPROVAL, so every ballot
 * was refused and the refusal swallowed; SIGN then threw from SIMULATED, and
 * every approver was told "Approved, but the payment could not be completed."
 *
 * ─── Who may release the money ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A vote can arrive without a session. A payment does not leave without one.
 *
 * WhatsApp proves which handset a message came from, not who was holding it or
 * whether they are signed in. This path used to carry the payment out from the
 * webhook anyway, by replaying the money route with an empty cookie. The route
 * reads its session through `cookies()`, found none, and refused. It could have
 * been handed an identity instead. It is not given one: a replay that
 * authenticates as "the approval" is a second way into the two money routes
 * with no person behind it, and a SIM swap or an unlocked phone would then be
 * enough to move money past maker-checker.
 *
 * So:
 *
 *   a unanimous reply takes the payment as far as APPROVED, every ballot
 *   recorded on it, and stops there. It waits for a signed-in approver;
 *
 *   a code typed into Splash arrives with a session. When it completes the
 *   vote, that approver releases the payment, provided they hold an approving
 *   role in the payment's own org, did not make it, and are signed in to that
 *   org, because the replay runs as their session;
 *
 *   a signed-in approver can also release a payment approved over WhatsApp,
 *   in the app, through proposals/[id]/submit, which runs the same walk.
 *
 * The money moves only through a replay of the real authorize route, so every
 * guard runs again against current state (lib/server/approval-execution.ts).
