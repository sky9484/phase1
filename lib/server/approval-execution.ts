/**
 * What an approval actually causes.
 *
 * ─── The gap this closes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The maker-checker path was complete right up to the last inch. A payment over
 * the threshold became a proposal; the proposal appeared in the queue; a second
 * approver signed it; the state machine walked SIMULATED -> PENDING_APPROVAL ->
 * SIGNED -> SUBMITTED.
 *
 * And then nothing. `SUBMITTED` was terminal in practice: nothing dispatched
 * SETTLE, and the payload a payment would be rebuilt from lived in a `Map` on
 * `globalThis` whose only reference in the entire repository was its own
 * definition. Two approvers signed, the queue showed the run as submitted, and
 * no money moved.
 *
 * That is worse than having no approval flow, because everybody involved
 * believes the payment went. A maker who is told "approved" does not re-send.
 *
 * ─── Why execution re-runs the guards ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The payload is replayed through the SAME authorize path a direct payment
 * takes, not through a shortcut that trusts the approval. Time passed between
 * proposing and approving — possibly a day. In that window the balance can have
 * drained, the corridor can have been paused, the beneficiary can have failed
 * screening, and the daily ceiling can have been consumed by other payments.
 *
 * An approval says "this payment is authorised", not "skip the checks". It
 * removes the requirement for a second approver, because that is precisely
 * what it supplied, and the maker's second factor, which was spent proposing
 * the payment and cannot be presented again (lib/server/batch-approval.ts).
