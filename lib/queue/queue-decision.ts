/**
 * An approver's decision on the queue, and what the server says came of it.
 *
 * The queue board's Approve and Reject used to change React state and toast
 * "Approved & queued for settlement" without calling the server at all. The
 * proposal stayed where it was, and the approver walked away believing the
 * payment had gone — the one outcome an approval flow must never produce
 * (lib/server/approval-execution.ts says why).
 *
 * The decision now goes to `POST /api/proposals/[id]/submit`, the route the
 * chat's approve button uses, and this module turns its answer into what the
 * approver is told. Every outcome is the server's, word for word where the
 * server's words are the right ones: nothing here claims a payment went unless
 * the response carries an EXECUTED execution.
