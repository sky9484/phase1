/**
 * From "simulated" to "released", one way, whichever channel the approval came
 * through.
 *
 * ─── Why one implementation ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The in-app submit route re-evaluated policy at the moment of approval and
 * walked a proposal SIMULATED → POLICY_EVALUATED → PENDING_APPROVAL before it
 * counted anyone's approval. The WhatsApp and code channels did neither. They
 * applied APPROVE straight to the SIMULATED proposal a money route creates —
 * the state machine accepts APPROVE only from PENDING_APPROVAL — swallowed
 * each refusal, then failed to SIGN from SIMULATED. Every ballot-approved
 * payment ended "Approved, but the payment could not be completed", and had
 * it got further, a reply would have skipped the policy, expiry and
 * compliance re-check that a click in the app gets.
 *
 * A second copy of an approval path is a second set of rules. Both paths now
 * take these steps, in this order:
 *
 *   evaluateAtApproval    policy re-run now, then the walk to the approval gate
 *   recordApprovals       each approval through the state machine, which is
 *                         what enforces maker ≠ checker, approving roles and
 *                         distinct approvers
 *   releaseApproved       SIGN → SUBMIT, by an approver who is not the maker
 *
 * All synchronous, on purpose. A caller that reads the live proposal and runs
 * them with no await in between cannot interleave with another request in the
 * same process: of two approvals that land together, one releases the payment
 * and the other finds it already submitted.
