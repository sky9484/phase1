/// ReceiptV2 — immutable settlement receipts with USD-first amounts.
///
/// Replaces the Phase 1 scaffold which let any caller mutate the
/// `audit_anchor_id` of any receipt (M-03) and had no authorization on
/// `create_receipt` (L-05). Now receipts are AdminCap-gated and the audit
/// anchor link is set at creation time and immutable thereafter.
///
/// Design:
///   * `create_receipt` is AdminCap-gated. Off-chain settlement layer holds
///     the cap and mints receipts after on-chain settlement events fire.
///   * `audit_anchor_id` is set at creation. The `link_audit_anchor`
///     post-hoc mutator is REMOVED. If a receipt later needs to point at
///     a different anchor, create a new receipt; the old one stays as a
///     tamper-evident historical record.
///   * Verification emits a `VerificationChecked` event so off-chain
///     auditors can prove a digest was checked.
